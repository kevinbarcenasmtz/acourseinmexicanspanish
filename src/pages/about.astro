  <h2 id="the-gift">The Gift</h2>
  <p>
    Realistically speaking, this project started as a gift to my significant other. We both grew up
    acquiring different first languages and, as such, have been trying to teach each other our
    native languages to better converse with each other's families. They've done a tremendous amount
    of work helping me learn the Palestinian (Gaza) Arabic dialect, countless hours of patient
    explanation, correction, and cultural context that no textbook could provide.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wanted to create something in return. This course will never truly return the favor, nothing
    can replace the gift of being taught your partner's language with such care, but it's my attempt
    to do something meaningful. If it helps them (or anyone else) connect more deeply with Mexican
    Spanish speakers and Mexican culture, then it's served its purpose.
  </p>

  <h2 id="my-background">My Background</h2>
  <p>
    To be transparent about my qualifications and limitations. As an ESL student, Spanish was
    my primary language until middle school, and it continues to be the language I use outside of
    work and education. I never formally studied Spanish in the traditional sense, my knowledge comes
    from growing up in a Spanish-speaking household and community, supplemented by AP Spanish
    Language & Composition and AP Spanish Literature in high school.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, one of my bachelor's degrees is in Linguistics, which has given me the tools to analyze
    and describe the language I grew up speaking. This linguistic training informs the phonetic
    transcriptions, grammatical explanations, and structural approach throughout this course. I feel
    confident in my ability to teach Mexican Spanish as it's actually spoken, not just as it appears
    in textbooks.
  </p>

  <p>
    That said, <strong>I'm not infallible</strong>. I make mistakes. My intuitions about the
    language might sometimes be idiosyncratic. My explanations might not always be as clear as they
    could be. If you notice errors, unnatural phrasing, unclear explanations, or anything that seems
    odd, <strong>please let me know</strong> at{' '}
    <a href="mailto:kab5987@my.utexas.edu">kab5987@my.utexas.edu</a>. This is a living resource that
    improves with feedback from learners and native speakers.
  </p>

  <h2 id="the-variety-taught">The Variety Taught</h2>
  <p>
    Both of my parents grew up in the states of Zacatecas and Guanajuato, in small towns and
    villages, what we call <em>ranchos</em>. The Spanish I grew up with, the Spanish I consider
    "Mexican Spanish," is the Spanish of the rancho. It's the language of rural central (north?) Mexico, with
    its distinctive vocabulary, pronunciation, and cultural context.
  </p>

  <p>
    This course reflects that variety. You won't find the polished, educated urban Mexican Spanish
    of textbooks and language academies of let's say Monterrey. You'll find the Spanish spoken at family gatherings in
    small towns, at markets in rural communities, in conversations that weave together traditional
    expressions with modern life. This is the living language, the kind you need if you want
    to connect with people from these communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where urban Mexican Spanish or other varieties differ significantly, I'll provide notes. But the
    foundation of this course is rancho Spanish, because that's the variety I know intimately and
    can teach with confidence.
  </p>

  <h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    This project was directly inspired by{' '}
    <a href="https://al3arabiya.org/a-course-in-levantine-arabic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      <em>A Course in Levantine Arabic</em>
    </a>{' '}
    by Ernest McCarus, Hamdi Qalisheh, and Raji Rammuny. That course demonstrated something powerful:
    you can teach a non-standard, dialectal variety of a language with the same rigor and systematic approach
    typically reserved for "standard" varieties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as Levantine Arabic differs from Modern Standard Arabic, Mexican rancho Spanish differs
    from the formal, standardized Spanish of textbooks. Just as learners benefit from authentic
    Levantine materials, learners of Mexican Spanish benefit from authentic rancho materials. The
    pedagogical structure of this course: dialogues, vocabulary cards, pronunciation notes, grammar
    explanations, cultural context, progressive drills mirrors the Levantine Arabic model because it
    works.
  </p>

  <h2 id="feedback-welcome">Feedback Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    This course is a work in progress. As I develop new lessons, I'm constantly refining the
    approach, improving explanations, and incorporating feedback. If you're using this resource and
    have thoughts <i>positive or critical</i> I want to hear them.

  <h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
  <p>
    First and foremost, thank you to my significant other for teaching me Arabic with such patience
    and care, and for inspiring this project. Thank you to my parents for raising me in a
    Spanish-speaking home and passing on the language and culture of Zacatecas and Guanajuato.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you to the creators of <em>A Course in Levantine Arabic</em> for demonstrating what effective
    dialectal language teaching looks like. Your pedagogical approach has been invaluable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you to everyone who has provided feedback, corrections, and suggestions as this course
    develops. Your contributions make this resource better for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    And thank you to you, the learner, for trusting this course to help you learn Mexican Spanish. I
    hope it serves you well.
