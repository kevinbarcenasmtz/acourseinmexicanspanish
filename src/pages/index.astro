    <h1>A Course in Mexican Spanish</h1>
    <body
      >This is a course/resource for the Spanish spoken throughtout Mexico today. While this course
      does not specifically cover all the different regional accents & dialects, it aims to
      provide a comprehensive overview of the language. Additionally, this website/resource was
      created primarily for my partner who is in the process of learning Spanish! I myself am
      currently in the process of learning the Levantine dialect of Arabic (primarily the
      Palestinian Gaza dialect) & it's been through her help that I've been able to progress &
      learn the language from a firsthand source. This is merely a way for me to repay all she's
      done for me. As such I hope this reaches those who are interested in learning language for any
      reason whatsoever, as it is through language where one & another can communicate, converse, &
      form relationships with people from different backgrounds & cultures.
