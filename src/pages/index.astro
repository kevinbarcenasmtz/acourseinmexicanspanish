      <u>A Course in Mexican Spanish</u> was initally a project created for my significant other. As lessons are being developed I decided to
      make the website public so anyone with the need or want to learn the Spanish language as spoken in Mexico can use it.
      The aim of this resource is to be a comprehensive Mexican Spanish learning resource designed
      for English speakers, it assumes a very basic exposure to Spanish. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The course or at least the presentation of the content mirrors closely the structure and format of <u>A Course in Levantine Arabic</u> by Ernest McCarus, Hamdi Qalisheh, & Raji Rammuny.
      It can be found here if you're interested <a>https://al3arabiya.org/a-course-in-levantine-arabic/</a>
    </p>

    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      If you're new to this resource, I recommend starting with the
      <a href="/front-matter/introduction">Introduction to Mexican Spanish</a> and the
      <a href="/front-matter/how-to-use">How to Use This Resource</a> guide.
    </p>

    <p>The course is divided into three main sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Foundation</strong> (Lessons 1-10): Basic greetings, family, everyday situations
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Intermediate</strong> (Lessons 11-20): Past tenses, complex conversations, travel
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advanced</strong> (Lessons 21-30): Subjunctive, formal situations, cultural deep dives
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
    <p>Each lesson in this course includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dialogues</strong> with realistic Mexican Spanish conversations</li>
      <li><strong>IPA transcriptions</strong> for precise pronunciation guidance</li>
      <li><strong>Vocabulary cards</strong> with definitions and notes</li>
      <li><strong>Grammar notes</strong> explaining structures in context</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural notes</strong> providing social and historical context</li>
      <li><strong>Practice drills</strong> with collapsible answers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="how-to-navigate">How to Navigate</h2>

      Use the <strong>left sidebar</strong> to navigate between lessons and sections. On each page, the
      <strong>right sidebar</strong> shows a table of contents for quick navigation within the page.
