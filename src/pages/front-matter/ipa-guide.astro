  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This guide explains the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols used throughout this
    course to represent Mexican Spanish pronunciation. Unlike Spanish spelling, IPA shows exactly
    how words are pronounced, capturing features like vowel reduction, consonant softening, and
    natural assimilation.
  </p>

  <p>
    You don't need to memorize this guide. Use it as a reference when you encounter unfamiliar
    symbols in lessons. After a few lessons, common symbols will become automatic.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">How to Use This Guide</div>
    <p>
      Each symbol includes: (1) the IPA symbol itself, (2) an articulatory description (how to
      produce the sound), (3) a Spanish example word, and (4) an English approximation when
      possible. Keep this page open in another tab while studying lessons.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="consonants">Consonants</h2>

  <p>
    Consonants are organized by place and manner of articulation. Mexican Spanish consonants are
    generally softer than English consonants, especially in intervocalic (between vowels) positions.
  </p>

  <h2 id="vowels">Vowels</h2>

  <p>
    Spanish has five pure vowel phonemes. In Mexican Spanish, vowels may be reduced or devoiced in
    unstressed positions, especially in rapid speech.

    Diacritics modify base symbols to show variations in pronunciation. Suprasegmental features
    indicate stress, length, and tone.

  <h2 id="mexican-features">Mexican Spanish-Specific Features</h2>

  <p>
    These features are characteristic of Mexican Spanish pronunciation and may differ from other
    Spanish varieties:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Yeísmo:</strong> No distinction between /ʎ/ (as in Peninsular Spanish <em>llover</em>)
    and /ʝ/ or /ʤ/. In Mexican Spanish, both are pronounced as [ʝ] or [ʤ].
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Seseo:</strong> No distinction between /s/ and /θ/. Mexican Spanish uses only [s], never the
    "th" sound [θ] found in Peninsular Spanish.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Consonant Weakening:</strong> Intervocalic consonants (between vowels) are often softened.
    For example, /b/, /d/, /g/ become fricatives [β], [ð], [ɣ] between vowels.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Vowel Devoicing:</strong> In rapid speech, unstressed vowels (especially /i/ and /u/) may
    be partially or fully devoiced, shown with the diacritic [i̥] or [u̥].
  </p>

  <!-- Add more specific features as you discover them while writing lessons -->

  <h2 id="reading-tips">Tips for Reading IPA</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Start with familiar sounds:</strong> Focus first on symbols that represent sounds similar
    to English. Build confidence before tackling unfamiliar sounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Pay attention to stress:</strong> The [ˈ] mark shows which syllable is stressed. Spanish stress
    patterns differ from English, so this is crucial.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Practice syllable by syllable:</strong> Use the [.] syllable boundary markers to break words
    into manageable chunks. Pronounce each syllable separately, then combine them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Watch for allophonic variation:</strong> The same phoneme may have different pronunciations
    depending on position. For example, /d/ is [d] after /n/ or at the start of a word, but [ð] between
    vowels.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Listen and compare:</strong> When native speaker recordings are available, listen while reading
    the IPA transcription. This reinforces the connection between symbol and sound.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Don't aim for perfection:</strong> IPA helps you approximate authentic pronunciation. Close
    enough is fine - native speakers vary too.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">Common Beginner Mistakes</div>
    <p>
      Confusing [b] and [β] - they represent different sounds. [b] is a stop (like English "b"), [β]
      is a fricative (softer, more like "v" but with both lips). Similarly, [d] vs [ð], and [g] vs
      [ɣ]. Position in the word determines which variant is used.
    </p>

    This guide will expand as new sounds are introduced in lessons. If you encounter a symbol not
    yet listed here, it will be explained in the lesson where it first appears.
